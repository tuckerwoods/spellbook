# 5.5E Spellbook Website

Hello! I made this website over a few days to learn React and TailwindCSS. Currently not all the features are implemented, but I wanted to put it up on my portfolio anyways.

## Features
- Search spells by name

- Filter by spell class and level

- View full spell descriptions in modals

## Tech Stack
- React

- Tailwind CSS

- Headless UI for modals

- React Markdown

- JSON file for spells data

## Future Improvements
- User accounts that allow for users to make characters and save spells under them so they can keep track of what their character knows

- UI/UX enhancements for Accessibility
- 
- Mobile Improvments
